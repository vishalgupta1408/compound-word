Algorithm:-
The basic algorithm for searching for compound words is to iterate over the target words from longest to shortest and for each target word iterate over word list (again from longest to shortest) attempting to match if the target word "starts with" the match word. If the target word starts with the match word then recursively attempt to search the "tail" of the target word for matches. If any combination of words make up the target word it is considered a compound words and added to the result set and no longer processed (i.e. some of the words can be formed using different combinations of sub words, but for this exercise once a word is considered a compound word it doesn't matter or count if it can be formed multiple ways)
The algorithm presented here is recursive, but it would be interesting to investigate if the same algorithm could be achieved in a non-recursive implementation and how its performance would compare.
The key to the performance of the algorithm, beyond concurrency is to minimize the list of match words evaluated at step. The algorithm was optimized to find the longest compound word first it was still required to find all compound words and thus an exhaustive search was still required.
